<h1>Writing HTML</h1>

<p>Atom is the tool we'll use to write our web pages.</p>
<p> Download Atom <a href="https://atom.io/">here</a>.</p>
<p/>
<p>You can preview your web pages in Atom using the <b>atom-html-preview</b> package. To install the package in Atom:</p>
<li>Open the Atom->Preferences menu item.</li>
<li>Click the "+Insall+" tab</li>
<li>Type "atom-html-preview" into the search box.</li>
<li>Click on the "Install" button</li>
<p/>
<p>There is now a menu item Packages->Preview HTML->Enable Preview.  Use this to see how your page will look.</p>
<p/>
<h1>Source Control</h1>
<p>Lots of people will want to make changes to the website at the same time.  So what happen's if Charlie accidentally updates or deletes Sally's page?  Argh, she isn't going to be happy!  Don't worry, Charlie, we're going to use a tool called <b>GitHub</b> that allows us to keep all the changes we make, so as long as Sally "checked in" her page, we'll be able to get the old version back.  Phew!</p>
<p/>
<p>So here is how it works:</p>
