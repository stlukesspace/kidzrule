  <p>Here the image is just one image in the centre of the page.</p>
  <p>The trouble with this layout is that it might distract from your page content.</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>You can't be sure when your text will lie over the image</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>A better idea is to use a small repeating image to make a background wallpaper<p>
